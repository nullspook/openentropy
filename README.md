*Collect entropy from on-device hardware sources, analyze source quality with statistical tests, and deliver raw or conditioned output through CLI, Rust, Python, and HTTP interfaces.*

**One workflow for entropy research, validation, and cryptographic deployment.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
cargo install openentropy-cli

# Discover entropy sources on your machine
openentropy scan

# Benchmark all fast sources
openentropy bench

# Output 64 random hex bytes
openentropy stream --format hex --bytes 64

# Live TUI dashboard
openentropy monitor
```

> By default, only fast sources (<2s) are used. Pass `all` as a positional argument to include slower sources (DNS, TCP, GPU, BLE).

### Python

```bash
pip install openentropy
```

```python
from openentropy import EntropyPool, detect_available_sources

sources = detect_available_sources()
print(f"{len(sources)} entropy sources available")

pool = EntropyPool.auto()
source = sources[0]["name"]
data = pool.get_source_bytes(source, 256, conditioning="sha256")
```

Build from source (native extension):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amenti-labs/openentropy.git && cd openentropy
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```

---

## Two Audiences

**Security engineers** use OpenEntropy to validate entropy quality and seed CSPRNGs:
```bash
openentropy analyze --profile security --output audit.md
```

**Researchers** use OpenEntropy to study raw noise characteristics:
```bash
openentropy analyze --profile deep --output analysis.json
```

Security engineers seed CSPRNGs, generate keys, and supplement `/dev/urandom` with independent hardware entropy. The SHA-256 conditioned output (`--conditioning sha256`, the default) produces cryptographic-quality random bytes. The `security` profile enables the NIST test battery, min-entropy breakdown, and SHA-256 conditioning in one flag.

Researchers study the raw noise characteristics of hardware subsystems. Pass `--conditioning raw` to get unwhitened, unconditioned bytes that preserve the actual noise signal from each source. The `deep` profile enables 100K samples, cross-correlation, and PEAR-style trial analysis.

Raw mode enables:
- **Hardware characterization** — measure min-entropy, autocorrelation, and spectral properties of individual noise sources
- **Silicon validation** — compare noise profiles across chip revisions, thermal states, and voltage domains
- **Anomaly detection** — monitor entropy source health for signs of hardware degradation or tampering
- **Cross-domain analysis** — study correlations between independent entropy domains (thermal vs timing vs IPC)

---

## What Makes This Different

Most random number generators are **pseudorandom** — deterministic algorithms seeded once. OpenEntropy continuously harvests **real physical noise** from your hardware:

- **Thermal noise** — three independent oscillator beats (CPU crystal vs audio PLL, display PLL, PCIe PHY PLLs)
- **Timing and microarchitecture** — clock phase noise, DRAM row buffer conflicts, speculative execution variance, TLB shootdowns, DVFS races, ICC bus contention, prefetcher state, APRR JIT timing, ANE clock domain crossing
- **I/O and IPC** — disk and NVMe latency (including IOKit sensor polling, raw device, and Linux passthrough), USB enumeration, Mach port IPC, pipe buffer allocation, kqueue events, fsync journal
- **GPU and compute** — GPU warp divergence, IOSurface cross-domain timing, Neural Engine inference timing
- **Scheduling and system** — nanosleep drift, GCD dispatch queues, thread lifecycle, P/E-core migration, timer coalescing, kernel counters, process table snapshots
- **Network and sensors** — DNS resolution timing, TCP handshake variance, WiFi RSSI, BLE ambient RF, audio ADC noise
- **Deep hardware** — dual clock domain beats, SITVA, AES-XTS context switching, SEV broadcast, COMMPAGE seqlock, SMC thermistor, getentropy TRNG reseed

The pool XOR-combines independent streams. No single source failure can compromise the pool.

### Conditioning Modes

Conditioning is **optional and configurable**. Use `--conditioning` on the CLI or `?conditioning=` on the HTTP API:

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **SHA-256** (default) | `--conditioning sha256` | SHA-256 conditioning. Cryptographic quality output. |
| **Von Neumann** | `--conditioning vonneumann` | Debiasing only — removes bias while preserving more of the raw signal structure. |
| **Raw** | `--conditioning raw` | No processing. Source bytes with zero whitening — preserves the actual hardware noise signal for research. |

Raw mode is what makes OpenEntropy useful for research. Most HWRNG APIs run DRBG post-processing that makes every source look like uniform random bytes, destroying the information researchers need. Raw output preserves per-source noise structure: bias, autocorrelation, spectral features, and cross-source correlations. See [Conditioning](https://amenti-labs.github.io/openentropy/concepts/conditioning/) for details.

[Source Catalog](https://amenti-labs.github.io/openentropy/concepts/sources/).

## CLI Reference

For the full command reference and examples, see [CLI Reference](https://amenti-labs.github.io/openentropy/cli/reference/).

Most-used workflows:

```bash
openentropy scan
openentropy bench
openentropy stream --format hex --bytes 64
openentropy analyze --profile security         # NIST battery + entropy + sha256
openentropy analyze --profile deep             # 100K + forensic + cross-corr + trials
openentropy record clock_jitter --duration 30s
openentropy sessions sessions/<id> --profile deep
openentropy compare sessions/<id-a> sessions/<id-b> --profile deep
```

On `sessions`, profile presets apply only when a specific session path is
provided. `openentropy sessions` with no path always stays in list mode.

PEAR-style trial methodology references (200-bit trials, terminal Z, weighted
Stouffer composition, calibration gating) are documented in
[Trial Analysis Methodology](https://amenti-labs.github.io/openentropy/concepts/trials/).

## Rust API

```toml
[dependencies]
openentropy-core = "0.12"
```

```rust
use openentropy_core::{ConditioningMode, EntropyPool, detect_available_sources};

let sources = detect_available_sources();
println!("{} sources available", sources.len());

let pool = EntropyPool::auto();
let source = pool.source_names()[0].clone();
let bytes = pool
    .get_source_bytes(&source, 256, ConditioningMode::Sha256)
    .unwrap();
let health = pool.health_report();
```

Analyze and compare entropy data programmatically:

```rust
use openentropy_core::{full_analysis, compare, trial_analysis};

let data = pool.get_source_raw_bytes(&source, 5000).unwrap();

// Per-source statistical analysis
let analysis = full_analysis(&source, &data);
println!("Shannon entropy: {:.4} bits/byte", analysis.shannon_entropy);

// Differential comparison of two streams
let other = pool.get_source_raw_bytes(&source, 5000).unwrap();
let diff = compare("stream_a", &data, "stream_b", &other);

// PEAR-style trial analysis
let trials = trial_analysis(&data, &Default::default());
println!("Terminal Z: {:.4}, p = {:.4}", trials.terminal_z, trials.terminal_p_value);
```

Chaos theory analysis (distinguish true randomness from deterministic chaos):

```rust
use openentropy_core::chaos::chaos_analysis;

let result = chaos_analysis(&data);
println!("Hurst H={:.4}, Lyapunov λ={:.4}, D₂={:.4}",
    result.hurst.hurst_exponent,
    result.lyapunov.lyapunov_exponent,
    result.correlation_dimension.dimension);
```
