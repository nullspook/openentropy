# Changelog

## 0.12.3 — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- Bumped the `qcicada` dependency to `0.2.2`.
- QCicada collection now enters device continuous mode through `start_continuous_fresh()`, discarding already-buffered device input once after mode entry so the first read is fresher.

## 0.12.2 — 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- Included the synchronized `Cargo.lock` workspace version updates required for release publishing.
- Re-cut the 0.12.x patch release so the crates.io publish job can run with `--locked`.
- QCicada collection now uses the device's continuous mode instead of repeated one-shot reads, avoiding stale data from the prefilled `ready_bytes` buffer between requests.

## 0.12.1 — 2026-03-09

### Added

- Added a shared core source-resolution helper so CLI-style convenience matching and SDK exact matching no longer drift across surfaces.
- Added router-level HTTP contract tests for `/api/v1/random`, `/sources`, and `/pool/status`, including malformed query rejection and source-row schema checks.
- Added README visibility for supported external QRNG hardware, including the `qcicada` source for the Crypta Labs QCicada USB QRNG.

### Changed

- Session recording now enforces a non-empty, declared source set across core, CLI, and Python bindings.
- Session comparison now respects per-source session boundaries instead of flattening mixed-source recordings.
- HTTP API contracts are now stricter and clearer:
  - invalid `conditioning` and `type` values return `400`
  - malformed query extraction returns JSON errors
  - `length` consistently means bytes
  - `/pool/status` uses `sources_healthy`
  - `/sources` and `/pool/status` expose `autocorrelation`
- Documentation, package metadata, and examples were aligned with implemented CLI, Python, and HTTP behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed silent fallback behavior in the HTTP random endpoint for invalid request modes and out-of-range parameters.
- Fixed Python `record()` and session-writing edge cases around empty sources, unknown sources, duplicates, invalid durations, and bounded recording duration.
- Fixed `EntropyPool` timeout backoff handling so timed-out sources remain backed off even after late worker completion.
- Fixed CI instability on macOS runners by making timeout/backoff tests assert semantics without relying on unrealistically tight scheduler timing.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- Expanded core analysis coverage with new `statistics`, `temporal`, and `synchrony` modules.
- Added extended chaos and entropy-complexity methods (SampEn, ApEn, DFA, RQA, rolling/bootstrap Hurst, permutation entropy, Anderson-Darling).
- Added Python binding parity for all newly introduced analysis capabilities.
- Added concept docs for temporal/statistics/synchrony analysis and expanded SDK references.

### Changed

- CLI `analyze` now supports tiered analysis flags: `--chaos` (core), `--chaos-extended`, `--temporal`, `--statistics`, and `--synchrony`.
- `deep` profile now enables core + extended research tiers (except synchrony, which requires explicit 2+ source selection).
- README branding now uses the no-text logo and includes explicit attribution for external analysis-method inspiration.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-03-03

  - Getting Started
  - Quick References
  - CLI / Python SDK / Rust SDK
  - Analysis & Validation
  - Concepts
  - Guides
- **Analysis hub refactor** — Converted `concepts/analysis.md` from a monolithic long-form page into a hub page linking to focused deep-dive docs.
- **Sources hub refactor** — Converted `concepts/sources.md` into a catalog hub linking to category-specific source pages.
- **Quickstart expansion** — Added practical CLI workflow examples including TUI (`openentropy monitor`), `all`/source-targeted usage, profile-driven analysis, output files, telemetry, calibration, sessions, and compare flows.
- **Cross-link cleanup** — Replaced anchor-fragile analysis links with stable dedicated page links in SDK and CLI docs.

### Removed

- **Integrations guide page** — Removed `website/src/content/docs/guides/integrations.md` from the docs site navigation.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Chaos theory analysis module** — Added `openentropy_core::chaos` with five methods: Hurst exponent (R/S), Lyapunov exponent (Rosenstein), correlation dimension (Grassberger-Procaccia), BiEntropy/TBiEntropy, and epiplexity (compression-based structure detection).
- **CLI `--chaos` flag** — Added opt-in chaos analysis to `openentropy analyze`; outputs PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts for each metric per source.
- **Deep profile chaos integration** — `--profile deep` now enables chaos analysis by default.
- **Chaos documentation** — Added method explanations, thresholds, and usage examples to `docs/CLI.md` and architecture notes to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- **Python SDK: 21 new analysis/comparison/trials bindings** — Full programmatic parity with CLI analysis capabilities via PyO3.
- **9 analysis functions** — `full_analysis`, `autocorrelation_profile`, `spectral_analysis`, `bit_bias`, `distribution_stats`, `stationarity_test`, `runs_analysis`, `cross_correlation_matrix`, `pearson_correlation`. All accept `bytes` and return `dict` (or `float` for `pearson_correlation`).
- **9 comparison functions** — `compare`, `aggregate_delta`, `two_sample_tests`, `cliffs_delta`, `temporal_analysis`, `digram_analysis`, `markov_analysis`, `multi_lag_analysis`, `run_length_comparison`. Differential statistical analysis between two byte streams.
- **3 trials functions** — `trial_analysis`, `stouffer_combine`, `calibration_check`. PEAR-style trial analysis with Stouffer combination across sessions.
- **`pythonize`/`depythonize` serialization** — All Rust structs serialized to Python dicts via `pythonize`. `stouffer_combine` accepts Python dicts and deserializes via `depythonize` for round-trip support.
- **Comparison module re-exports** — `openentropy_core::compare()`, `openentropy_core::ComparisonResult`, etc. now accessible from crate root.
- **CLI `compare` subcommand** — Differential session comparison with forensic analysis (KS, chi-squared, Cliff's delta, temporal anomalies, Markov, digram, run-length).
- **CLI analysis profiles** — `--profile quick|standard|deep|security` presets for `analyze`, `sessions`, and `compare` commands.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Quantum source category** — New `SourceCategory::Quantum` and `Requirement::QCicada` for true quantum random number generators.
- **QCicada USB QRNG source** — Crypta Labs QCicada integration via the `qcicada` crate. Reads photonic shot noise entropy at 8 bits/byte. Supports three on-device modes: `raw`, `sha256`, `samples`. Auto-detects USB serial port.
- **`--qcicada-mode` CLI flag** — Set QCicada post-processing mode (`raw`/`sha256`/`samples`) on `bench`, `analyze`, `record`, `stream`, and `scan` commands.
- **`record --all`** — Record from every available source with a single flag.
- **TUI multiselect recording** — Select multiple sources with `Space`/`Enter`, then press `r` to record from all selected simultaneously.
- **TUI help modal** — Press `?` for a full keybinding reference overlay.
- **TUI category grouping** — Sources organized into collapsible category groups with `{`/`}` jump navigation and `C` fold all.
- **Requirement metadata** — `icon()`, `label()`, `from_display_name()` helpers on `Requirement` enum for CLI/TUI display.

### Changed

- **Analyze command redesigned** — Replaced verdict-driven summary/detailed views with compact forensic output (spectral, bias, stationarity, runs, distribution). Removed `--view` flag. `--entropy` is now opt-in (was `--no-entropy`).
- **Pool batched parallel collection** — Fixed batch counting to only track current chunk indices; added 50ms drain timeout for threads completing after batch loops.
- **Pool `collect_enabled_n`** — Now uses detached threads with 10-second timeout instead of scoped threads, preventing hangs on slow sources.
- **`record` source arg no longer required** — Positional source names are optional when `--all` is used.
- **`QCicadaConfig` via `OnceLock`** — Thread-safe CLI mode override without `unsafe set_var`.

### Fixed

- **QCicada returns 0 bytes after prior session** — Added retry with 500ms backoff on `try_open()` and reconnect-on-error for `random()` calls. USB serial devices need settle time after handle release.
- **Analyze/report empty data from hardware sources** — Both `run_analysis()` and `run_report()` retry `collect()` once after 1-second delay when a source returns empty data.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-02-27

### Added

- **`record --all`** — Record from every available source with a single flag, matching `bench`, `analyze`, and `stream`. Positional source names remain supported.
- **TUI multiselect recording** — Select multiple sources with `Space`/`Enter` (yellow = selected), then press `r` to record from all selected sources simultaneously. Recording uses 1000-byte samples for throughput regardless of display sample size.
- **TUI help modal** — Press `?` for a full keybinding reference overlay.
- **Quantum category** — New `quantum` source category with QCicada QRNG source. Live mode switching (`m` key) cycles between raw/sha256/samples post-processing modes.
- **TUI category grouping** — Sources organized into collapsible category groups with `{`/`}` jump navigation and `C` fold all.
- **14 new entropy sources** across timing, scheduling, network, signal, and microarch categories.

### Changed

- **Source directory reorganization** — 63 sources moved from flat layout into 13 category-based subdirectories (`gpu/`, `io/`, `ipc/`, `microarch/`, `network/`, `quantum/`, `scheduling/`, `sensor/`, `signal/`, `system/`, `thermal/`, `timing/`).
- **Pool batched parallel collection** for improved throughput.
- **TUI source selection unified** — `Space`/`Enter` toggles sources on/off (selected = yellow, active = yellow+bold+`●`). No separate mark/select distinction.
- Source count increased from 45 to 63.

### Removed

- **TUI compare overlay** (`Tab`) — Removed non-functional compare feature. The compare source never received live data; only showed stale history.

### Fixed

- **SIGILL crash from undocumented register probes** — Added `probe_jit_instruction_safe()` fork-based probe for `gxf_register_timing` (S3\_6\_c15\_c1\_5) and `dual_clock_domain` (S3\_1\_c15\_c0\_6, S3\_4\_c15\_c10\_5). These undocumented Apple Silicon registers may not be accessible on all chips/OS versions; the fork probe prevents process-killing SIGILL.
- **cargo fmt** — Applied formatting to all source files.
- **Source extraction pipeline fixes** — Corrected entropy extraction in `dual_clock_domain` (phase data, not timing deltas), `mach_timing` (raw truncation → proper pipeline), `preemption_boundary` (sparse events), `amx_timing` (deterministic workload → LCG randomization), `clock_jitter` (fake entropy from epoch bytes), `dns_timing`/`tcp_connect` (weak LSB extraction), `smc_highvar_timing`/`getentropy_timing` (cross-platform compatibility).
- **Invalid entropy rate estimates** — `ane_timing` (1800→3.0), `nvme_iokit_sensors` (1500→3.0).
- **Slow source timeouts** — `nl_inference_timing` and `spotlight_timing` now reliably complete within pool budget.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-02-23

### Changed

- **Pool collection no longer blocks health reads.** `SourceState.source` changed from `Box<dyn EntropySource>` to `Arc<dyn EntropySource>`. The pool mutex is now released during `collect()` calls, allowing `health_report()` and TUI updates to proceed without blocking on slow sources.
- `run_server` now returns `std::io::Result<()>` instead of panicking on bind/serve failures. Server CLI handles `Runtime::new()` failure gracefully.
- Server `SourceEntry` and pool status API now include `min_entropy` field.
- Deduplicated CoreAudio FFI bindings into shared `coreaudio_ffi` module used by `audio_pll_timing` and `counter_beat` (~160 lines removed).

### Removed

- **`memory_timing`** — true duplicate of `vm_page_timing` (identical mmap→write_volatile→munmap pattern). Use `vm_page_timing` instead.
- **`gpu_timing`** — strictly inferior to `gpu_divergence` (~47s via sips subprocess vs ~0.8s native Metal compute, same GPU clock domain). Use `gpu_divergence` instead.
- Source count reduced from 47 to 45. All documentation and metadata updated.

### Fixed

- **Mach IPC port lifecycle** — Fixed use-after-free (`mach_port_deallocate` before `mach_port_mod_refs` on same port), send right leak on cleanup, and `MachMsgOOLDescriptor` struct field order (`type` and `pad` were swapped vs XNU kernel layout).
- **CoreAudio constant** — `AUDIO_DEVICE_PROPERTY_ACTUAL_SAMPLE_RATE` was `0x61737264` ('asrd'), corrected to `0x61737274` ('asrt') per Apple SDK headers.
- **Signal handler safety** — `stream.rs` FIFO cleanup now pre-computes `CString` into a `OnceLock` and uses `libc::unlink`/`libc::_exit` instead of heap-allocating Rust stdlib functions inside the signal handler.
- **Network source runaway** — DNS and TCP entropy sources now have iteration caps to prevent infinite loops when all targets are unreachable.
- **Install script** — `VERSION` and `ASSET_NAME` were computed before `LATEST` was fetched, producing empty values.
- **Platform metadata consistency** — `process` corrected to `Platform::MacOS` (uses `/bin/ps`); `pipe_buffer` and `tlb_shootdown` `is_available()` aligned with `Platform::MacOS`; `vm_page_timing` corrected to `Platform::Any` (pure POSIX `mmap`).
- **Composite flag** — `cpu_io_beat` and `cpu_memory_beat` now correctly declare `composite: true`.
- **Binary paths** — `sysctl`, `uptime`, `vm_stat`, `netstat` now use full absolute paths (`/usr/sbin/sysctl`, etc.) in session and telemetry modules.
- **Documentation** — Corrected stale version references, source counts, CLI command counts, and code examples across SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, CONDITIONING.md, API.md, and per-crate READMEs. Renumbered SOURCES.md catalog (1-45 sequential, was 1-50 with gaps).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-02-22

### Added

- Telemetry system (`telemetry_v1`): `TelemetrySnapshot`, `TelemetryWindowReport`, and standalone `telemetry` CLI command with `--window-sec` support.
- Shannon entropy and min-entropy fields in `SourceAnalysis`.
- Server `/sources` and `/pool/status` endpoints now accept `?telemetry=true` for start/end telemetry reports.
- 20 frontier entropy sources exploiting previously-unharvested hardware nondeterminism (AMX timing, TLB shootdown, pipe buffer contention, Mach IPC, kqueue events, DVFS race, CAS contention, Keychain timing, audio PLL, counter beat, display PLL, PCIe PLL, and more).

### Changed

- Merged `device` command into `stream --fifo` and `report` command into `analyze --report`.
- Improved bench scoring: graduated reliability penalty, stability index edge-case fix, entropy-gated source interpretation.
- DRY refactoring: extracted `filter_sources`, `print_cross_correlation`, `write_json`, `unix_timestamp_now`, `parse_conditioning` into shared module.
- TUI chart mode now persists across source switches.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Added a Python source-parity CI check to ensure Python bindings expose the same detected source set as the Rust pool.
- Added dedicated package metadata docs:
  - `README.pypi.md` for PyPI
  - per-crate `README.md` files for crates.io rendering

### Fixed

- Updated release workflow PyPI publish command to valid `maturin publish` arguments.
- Expanded Python bindings parity with Rust core:
  - added missing metadata fields in health/source reports
  - added `source_names`, `get_source_bytes`, `get_source_raw_bytes`
  - added `platform_info`, `detect_machine_info`, and conditioning/quality helper exports
  - invalid conditioning mode now raises `ValueError` instead of silently defaulting
- Refreshed documentation to match current code paths and packaging:
  - rewritten `docs/PYTHON_SDK.md`
  - updated `docs/API.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - corrected Python install guidance and source-count references

## 0.5.0 — 2026-02-16

### Changed

- Major CLI UX update:
  - `bench` is now profile-driven (`quick`, `standard`, `deep`) with explicit configurability for rounds, warmup, timeout, and samples per round
  - `bench` now includes a pool-quality section by default (`--no-pool` to skip) and supports JSON output for automation
  - `analyze` now defaults to a verdict-driven summary view with `GOOD/WARNING/CRITICAL` status, top findings, and actionable recommendations
  - `analyze` defaults updated to `--samples 50000`, `--conditioning raw`, and min-entropy breakdown enabled by default (`--no-entropy` to skip)
- Session recording/analysis pipeline improvements:
  - session format v2 now stores both `raw.bin` and `conditioned.bin` streams with separate indexes and expanded `samples.csv` metrics
  - source-isolated recording path ensures conditioned data is derived from the exact raw sample it is paired with
- Entropy collection robustness improvements:
  - timeout-aware parallel collection with in-flight/backoff coordination to avoid repeated scheduling pressure from slow/hung sources
  - bounded raw-byte collection retries to prevent unbounded waiting

### Fixed

- TUI active-source sampling no longer contaminates history/recording with data from non-active sources.
- Unknown `source` parameter in server random endpoint now returns HTTP 400 with structured error.
- Statistical reporting language clarified to avoid overclaiming strict NIST compliance where heuristics are used.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Fixed release/install checksum flow so `install.sh` verifies against release `checksums-sha256.txt`
- Added `version()` export to Python package so examples and runtime version checks work
- Updated root `Makefile` targets to valid Rust workspace commands
- Made Python CI binding job strict and added a Python import smoke test

### Changed

- Synced Python package version to `0.4.1`

## 0.4.0 — 2026-02-13

### Source Taxonomy Refactor

- **Replaced 8 ad-hoc categories with 12 mechanism-based categories:** Thermal, Timing, Scheduling, IO, IPC, Microarch, GPU, Network, System, Composite, Signal, Sensor — each named after the physical mechanism that generates the entropy
- **Added `Platform` enum** (`Any`, `MacOS`, `Linux`) replacing string-based platform requirements
- **Added `Requirement` enum** (`Metal`, `AudioUnit`, `Wifi`, `Usb`, `Camera`, `AppleSilicon`, `Bluetooth`, `IOKit`, `IOSurface`, `SecurityFramework`) for precise hardware dependency tracking
- **Updated `SourceInfo` struct:** `platform_requirements: &[&str]` replaced with typed `platform: Platform` and `requirements: &[Requirement]`
- Updated `SourceInfoSnapshot` to include `platform` and `requirements` fields
- Updated CLI TUI category display with new short codes (THM, TMG, SCH, I/O, IPC, uAR, GPU, NET, SYS, CMP, SIG, SNS)
- All 44 sources reclassified by physical mechanism

### New Frontier Sources (39 → 36 total)

- **`dvfs_race`** — Cross-core DVFS frequency race. Spawns two threads on different CPU cores running tight counting loops; the difference in iteration counts captures physical frequency jitter from independent DVFS controllers.
- **`cas_contention`** — Multi-thread atomic CAS arbitration. 4 threads race on compare-and-swap operations targeting shared cache lines. Hardware coherence engine arbitration timing is physically nondeterministic.

### Research

- **6 proof-of-concept experiments** documented in `docs/findings/deep_research_2026-02-13.md`:
  - DRAM refresh interference timing (too low entropy)
  - P-core vs E-core frequency drift / software ring oscillator (promoted to dvfs_race)
  - Cache coherence fabric ICE timing (too deterministic)
  - Mach thread QoS scheduling (scheduler too quantized)
  - GPU/Accelerate framework timing (overlaps amx_timing)
  - Atomic CAS contention (promoted to cas_contention)

### Improvements

- Both new sources added to `FAST_SOURCES` (25 fast sources total)
- Comprehensive documentation updates: SOURCE_CATALOG, README, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE, all docs
- Version bump to 0.4.0 across workspace, pyproject.toml
- Removed dead code (vdsp_timing.rs)
- Quality audit: cut `sensor_noise` (redundant with ioregistry), `dyld_timing` (redundant with spotlight_timing), `multi_domain_beat` (too low entropy)
- Fixed stale source counts across all documentation and Cargo.toml files
- `cargo fmt` clean, zero clippy warnings, 212 tests passing

---
