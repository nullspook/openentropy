# Changelog

## 0.6.0 — 2026-02-22

### Added

- Telemetry system: `TelemetrySnapshot`, `TelemetryWindowReport`, and standalone `telemetry` CLI command with `--window-sec` support
- Shannon entropy and min-entropy fields in `SourceAnalysis`
- Entropy-gated source interpretation with grade-based thresholds
- FIFO cleanup on SIGINT/SIGTERM via `OnceLock` signal handler

### Changed

- Merged `device` command into `stream --fifo`
- Merged `report` command into `analyze --report`
- Graduated bench reliability penalty from binary 0.8x to scaled `1.0 - 0.5 * failure_rate`
- Probe mode now respects `--conditioning` and `--samples-per-round`, uses `grade_min_entropy`
- Case-insensitive conditioning mode parsing
- TUI chart mode persists when switching sources instead of resetting to RandomWalk
- DRY refactoring: extracted `filter_sources`, `print_cross_correlation`, `write_json`, `unix_timestamp_now`, `parse_conditioning` into shared module

### Fixed

- Serial test delta2 computation (was dead code)
- `stability_index` returning NaN for all-zero sample sets
- Duplicate sentence fragment in `counter_beat.rs` physics text
- Stale documentation references to removed `device` and `report` commands

## 0.5.1 — 2026-02-18

### Changed

- Added a Python source-parity CI check to ensure Python bindings expose the same detected source set as the Rust pool.
- Added dedicated package metadata docs:
  - `README.pypi.md` for PyPI
  - per-crate `README.md` files for crates.io rendering

### Fixed

- Updated release workflow PyPI publish command to valid `maturin publish` arguments.
- Expanded Python bindings parity with Rust core:
  - added missing metadata fields in health/source reports
  - added `source_names`, `get_source_bytes`, `get_source_raw_bytes`
  - added `platform_info`, `detect_machine_info`, and conditioning/quality helper exports
  - invalid conditioning mode now raises `ValueError` instead of silently defaulting
- Refreshed documentation to match current code paths and packaging:
  - rewritten `docs/PYTHON_SDK.md`
  - updated `docs/API.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - corrected Python install guidance and source-count references

## 0.5.0 — 2026-02-16

### Changed

- Major CLI UX update:
  - `bench` is now profile-driven (`quick`, `standard`, `deep`) with explicit configurability for rounds, warmup, timeout, and samples per round
  - `bench` now includes a pool-quality section by default (`--no-pool` to skip) and supports JSON output for automation
  - `analyze` now defaults to a verdict-driven summary view with `GOOD/WARNING/CRITICAL` status, top findings, and actionable recommendations
  - `analyze` defaults updated to `--samples 50000`, `--conditioning raw`, and min-entropy breakdown enabled by default (`--no-entropy` to skip)
- Session recording/analysis pipeline improvements:
  - session format v2 now stores both `raw.bin` and `conditioned.bin` streams with separate indexes and expanded `samples.csv` metrics
  - source-isolated recording path ensures conditioned data is derived from the exact raw sample it is paired with
- Entropy collection robustness improvements:
  - timeout-aware parallel collection with in-flight/backoff coordination to avoid repeated scheduling pressure from slow/hung sources
  - bounded raw-byte collection retries to prevent unbounded waiting

### Fixed

- TUI active-source sampling no longer contaminates history/recording with data from non-active sources.
- Unknown `source` parameter in server random endpoint now returns HTTP 400 with structured error.
- Statistical reporting language clarified to avoid overclaiming strict NIST compliance where heuristics are used.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Fixed release/install checksum flow so `install.sh` verifies against release `checksums-sha256.txt`
- Added `version()` export to Python package so examples and runtime version checks work
- Updated root `Makefile` targets to valid Rust workspace commands
- Made Python CI binding job strict and added a Python import smoke test

### Changed

- Synced Python package version to `0.4.1`

## 0.4.0 — 2026-02-13

### Source Taxonomy Refactor

- **Replaced 8 ad-hoc categories with 12 mechanism-based categories:** Thermal, Timing, Scheduling, IO, IPC, Microarch, GPU, Network, System, Composite, Signal, Sensor — each named after the physical mechanism that generates the entropy
- **Added `Platform` enum** (`Any`, `MacOS`, `Linux`) replacing string-based platform requirements
- **Added `Requirement` enum** (`Metal`, `AudioUnit`, `Wifi`, `Usb`, `Camera`, `AppleSilicon`, `Bluetooth`, `IOKit`, `IOSurface`, `SecurityFramework`) for precise hardware dependency tracking
- **Updated `SourceInfo` struct:** `platform_requirements: &[&str]` replaced with typed `platform: Platform` and `requirements: &[Requirement]`
- Updated `SourceInfoSnapshot` to include `platform` and `requirements` fields
- Updated CLI TUI category display with new short codes (THM, TMG, SCH, I/O, IPC, uAR, GPU, NET, SYS, CMP, SIG, SNS)
- All 44 sources reclassified by physical mechanism

### New Frontier Sources (39 → 36 total)

- **`dvfs_race`** — Cross-core DVFS frequency race. Spawns two threads on different CPU cores running tight counting loops; the difference in iteration counts captures physical frequency jitter from independent DVFS controllers.
- **`cas_contention`** — Multi-thread atomic CAS arbitration. 4 threads race on compare-and-swap operations targeting shared cache lines. Hardware coherence engine arbitration timing is physically nondeterministic.

### Research

- **6 proof-of-concept experiments** documented in `docs/findings/deep_research_2026-02-13.md`:
  - DRAM refresh interference timing (too low entropy)
  - P-core vs E-core frequency drift / software ring oscillator (promoted to dvfs_race)
  - Cache coherence fabric ICE timing (too deterministic)
  - Mach thread QoS scheduling (scheduler too quantized)
  - GPU/Accelerate framework timing (overlaps amx_timing)
  - Atomic CAS contention (promoted to cas_contention)

### Improvements

- Both new sources added to `FAST_SOURCES` (25 fast sources total)
- Comprehensive documentation updates: SOURCE_CATALOG, README, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE, all docs
- Version bump to 0.4.0 across workspace, pyproject.toml
- Removed dead code (vdsp_timing.rs)
- Quality audit: cut `sensor_noise` (redundant with ioregistry), `dyld_timing` (redundant with spotlight_timing), `multi_domain_beat` (too low entropy)
- Fixed stale source counts across all documentation and Cargo.toml files
- `cargo fmt` clean, zero clippy warnings, 212 tests passing

## 0.3.0 — 2026-02-12

### Complete Rust Rewrite

The entire project has been rewritten in Rust as a Cargo workspace with 5 crates:
`openentropy-core`, `openentropy-cli`, `openentropy-server`, `openentropy-tests`, and `openentropy-python`.

### Highlights
- **30 entropy sources** across 8 categories (timing, system, network, hardware, silicon, cross-domain, novel, frontier), all with SHA-256 conditioning
- **31 NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests** in a dedicated test suite crate
- **CLI with 9 commands**: `scan`, `probe`, `bench`, `stream`, `device`, `server`, `monitor`, `report`, `pool`
- **Interactive TUI monitor** built with ratatui — live charts, source toggling, RNG display
- **HTTP server** (axum) with ANU-compatible HTTP API
- **PyO3 Python bindings** via maturin for seamless Python interop
- **Zero clippy warnings**, cargo fmt clean across the entire workspace
- **24/27 available sources achieve Grade A** entropy quality

### Crate Breakdown
| Crate | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `openentropy-core` | EntropySource trait, 30 sources, pool, SHA-256 conditioning, platform detection |
| `openentropy-cli` | clap-based CLI with 9 commands including interactive TUI monitor |
| `openentropy-server` | axum HTTP server with ANU QRNG-compatible `/api/v1/entropy` endpoint |
| `openentropy-tests` | 31 NIST SP 800-22 statistical tests (frequency, runs, spectral, matrix rank, etc.) |
| `openentropy-python` | PyO3 bindings exposing sources, pool, and test suite to Python |
